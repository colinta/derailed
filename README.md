This is a simple iOS app written in RubyMotion.  I created this in a live-coding
session at one of [DeRailed]'s Meetup events, and thought it would be fun to
touch up and make available.

It uses:

- A `UITableView` to display...
- ...weather data loaded from Firebase
- has good separation of concerns and code organization
- has some specs
- has a classic browse/detail view structure
- lots of comments; why/how/gotchas/information.

And you can follow along in a step-by-step fashion.

The [follow_along.md][] file is updated in each commit with the goal of that
commit.  The 'Conclusion' contains all the commit history, so you can checkout
or browse the source easily.  The [changelog.md][] is a summary of the
follow_along.md entries.

Hope it helps!
